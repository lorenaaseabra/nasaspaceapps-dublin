### Key Features Implemented

âœ… **Complete Test Content Removal**
- Eliminated all "2 + 2", "test android", and debug questions
- Replaced with authentic NASA educational content

âœ… **Wave-Based Game Freezing**
- Game properly freezes during wave announcements across all 7 waves
- Smooth transitions between educational phases

âœ… **Card System Improvements**
- Removed flip functionality and "Do you know?" text
- Eliminated collection values for cleaner interface
- Implemented threat-based rarity system (Common â†’ Uncommon â†’ Epic â†’ Legendary)

âœ… **Educational Progression**
- Questions automatically adapt to current wave difficulty
- Bonus questions from next wave for high-performing players
- Progressive point scoring system

âœ… **Deployment Ready**
- Fixed Node.js 20 compatibility for Netlify
- Converted to ES module system
- Removed invalid build configurations

### Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/data/educationalQuestions.js` - Complete 70-question NASA curriculum
- `src/services/quizData.js` - Clean educational quiz system
- `src/gameLogic/gameProgression.js` - 7-wave progression logic
- `src/components/CardCollection.jsx` - Simplified card interface
- `src/components/WaveManager.jsx` - Enhanced wave management with freezing
- `netlify.toml` - Fixed deployment configuration

**Educational Question Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'unique_identifier',
  question: 'Educational question text',
  answers: ['Option A', 'Option B', 'Option C', 'Option D'],
  correctAnswer: 0, // Index of correct answer
  points: 25, // Points awarded for correct answer
  explanation: 'Educational explanation of the answer'
}
```

### Game Flow
1. Players start with Earth basics (Wave 1)
2. Progress through increasingly challenging space science topics
3. Each wave introduces new concepts building on previous knowledge  
4. Wave announcements pause gameplay for educational context
5. Final wave challenges players with advanced space science concepts

### Educational Goals Achieved
- **Progressive Learning**: Building from familiar (Earth) to advanced (Universe)
- **NASA Integration**: All content based on authentic space science
- **Engagement**: Game mechanics reinforce educational objectives
- **Assessment**: Point system provides immediate feedback
- **Exploration**: Encourages curiosity about space science careers

The AstroDefenders educational system now provides a complete space science curriculum suitable for middle to high school students, with authentic NASA content and engaging game mechanics that make learning about space exploration both fun and educational.
